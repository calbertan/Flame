Ever planed to go see a concert with a friend before they cancel last minute? A wasted
ticket is a common occurance and it can be a daunting task to quicksell that ticket. 
Flame is a secondhand ticket selling app that provides a platform for users to 
easily sell that ticket that they quickly need to get rid of. 
<br>
A more focused target market means that we are able to implement features that cater more towards our audience. Current shopping apps like ebay are very broad and allows everyone to sell anything they want, which can be overwhelming and make it harder to find that specific thing you want.
